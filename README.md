# Project Street Gears : Bug tracker

[![N|Solid](https://streetgears.eu/forum/images/igame/logo.png)](https://streetgears.eu)

The original is back! We're working on a private server for the game Street Gears originally led by GPotato. Our goal is to provide a fair and satisfying game experience. Donations are highly appreciated. We hope you're gonna enjoy our project as much as we do.

# Github goal

We obviously wont share the project's source code in this github. It will be instead used to share informations with beta-testers with the wiki, and for bug reports, with "Issues".
